                <th id="size"><p id="red">They are creatures that look like wolves in the first place, they will always appear in the shadow/out of your vision. You can spot them with their white eyes glowing in the dark. If you are not cautious about them and their spawns you are in danger. Especially if you hear a humming in the distance, that’s when they’re about to attack you. You can see when they attack you with their eyes which turn in bloody red. If your insanity bar isn’t too high then their hits are going to increase the bar, but in the case where your insanity bar is too high they are gonna hit you physically, they don't deal a lot of damage but they can scare you easily.</p></th>

                <th><p>Trickster</p></th>
                <th><p id="red">Tricksters are, like the name, tricky. They take the appearance of other creatures to trick you (like cows, wolves, deer, or anything that can live), you can spot them because when they transform you can see that some of their limbs are not in the right place. They are doing this to approach you and attack you from your back, if you manage to kill one of them before they do then you have the advantage of the damage, they are indeed very weak when transformed and if they aren’t transformed then they will flee to transform and attack you.</p></th>

                <th><p>Prawler</p></th>
                <th><p id="red">The prowlers are simple humans who crawl to move, they are very slow and very loud when moving but very strong in terms of resistance, if you have the idea to come close to them then you will face the consequences. In fact, they will scream so loud that it alerts other creatures around you in a few meters. Once they start screaming you can’t stop them, so be sure to avoid them.</p></th>

                <th><p id="red">They move really quickly because of their small body, they aren’t that much strong (very low HP) the best way to avoid problem with them is to knock them out. If they see you or you attack them, they will enter the “runaway” state, if they go far enough, they will bring other monsters to protect them and to take revenge (like a child with his parents)</p></th>
